         <h1>What is ice cream, really?</h1>
         <p>Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients, that has been frozen into a soft, creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years, but only become common place since the wide spread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to a number of ice cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.</p>

         <H1 id="#2"> Ice Cream in Music </H1>
         <p>
            While most of the content on this website is copied from the web, I did some research on Discogs to uncover the relationship between music and ice cream. Or basically how many times was the term used in "releases" titles etc.  
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               There are about 7,103 releases on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=ice+cream&type=release"> Discogs </a> with the term ice cream in their title. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Ice cream seems to be pretty popular in Indie Rock. 
            </li>
            <li>
               The 2000s seemed to have been the Ice Cream Era. I always thought it was the Milkshake era. Milkshake is popular in the House community, though.  
            </li>
            <li>
               The Spanish translation of the term does not seem to be as popular. Discogs is very comprehensive, so I doubt it is a data issue. 
            </li>

         <h1>What is healthier Ice Cream or Gelato? </h1>
         <p>
            Gelato is often mistakenly defined as the Italian word for ice cream. Despite their similarities, gelato and ice cream actually have a different composition and nutritional value. Gelato is more creamy and dense than ice cream and is often lower in calories, fat and sugar. Depending on the type and portion size you choose, gelato may not always be a healthier option than ice cream.
